## TODO

- string replacement for production/development
- use the output folder as the binary for git
- fix client folder
- push to all remotes
- open in browser
- replacement on index.html

some day

- document git targets origin/server
- when an exec command fails it displays ugly messages
- make it compile on the server? I do not like this makes pushing slow as it has to run all the npm stuff
