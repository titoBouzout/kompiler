# kompiler

A framework agnostic compiler/transpiler currently used mostly for solidjs projects. For personal use and for friends. Forever work in progress.

## Usage

TODO provide a forkeable repo to use this

## options

TODO

## TODO

- document options like additional watch
- make rollup watch additional folders to restart the compiler preventing from opening a new tab each time by restarting the whole thing
- make it compile on the server? I do not like this makes pushing slow as it has to run all the npm stuff
- document git targets origin/server
- when an exec command fails it displays ugly messages
- use .cache for diff files
